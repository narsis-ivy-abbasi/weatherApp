I've created a weather app using JavaScript and integrated a weather API to fetch real-time weather data. It was an exciting learning experience and Iâ€™m grateful for the free resources available online.

A special thanks to "GreatStack" for their fantastic tutorials that guided me through the process! Check out their channel here: https://youtu.be/lpx2zFkapIk?si=ehGt7v0Qx9chm9Ew

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
